AJAX Practice
=============

Following along with the Railscast regarding Ajaxing a resource, reinforcing the concept by doing it for myself. Ajax is used to communicate with the server without a full page load, so it improves the User Experience. If you wish to see a more fully developed implementation of Ajax, look at the "Blog" resource in my WorkingPortfolio repo or in the Order creation form of the "Grubly" app that Dylan Grant and I co-wrote.
